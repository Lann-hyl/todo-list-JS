## TODO List project
A small TODO list project in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The initial code is based on this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/THEKW1gITJI) by Coding2GO, but I have added my own features such as: 
- Editing and deleting the task.
- Task quantities.
- Task deadline (date and time).
- Task reordering via drag-and-drop.
- Write a description for the task.
- Downloading the list to a `.json` file and loading the list from it.
- Task information are saved in browser storage with localStorage as well.

The app can be found and interacted with [here](https://lann-hyl.github.io/todo-list-JS/).
