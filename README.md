## TODO List project
A small TODO list project in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The initial code is based on this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/THEKW1gITJI) by Coding2GO, but I have added my own features such as: 
- Editing and deleting the task
- Task quantities
- Task deadline
- Task reordering via drag-and-drop

Task information are saved with localStorage (JSON)

The app can be found and interacted with [here](https://lann-hyl.github.io/todo-list-JS/).
